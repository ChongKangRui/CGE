Window.h
//base class of window, can be seem as an interface 

WindowsWindow.h
//window class that inherited the functions from window.h, will be used to initialize a new window in EngineApplication


---------LogicExplanation
-All the lambda retrieve the data from the pointer that set at glfwSetWindowUserPointer
-everytime glfw detect the input that it set below, 
-it will call the binded function(which is onevent in engine application that bind when initialized) data.EventCallback(event); 
-and once onevent being call, all the layer in layer stack 
-onevent will be called as well which is where we bind the event into the dispatcher

-Window Update should also handling all the glfw input polling, glfw swap buffers etc(the necessary glfw setup in the window while loop)
