Event.h(mouseevent.h, keyevent.h, windowevent.h)
//contain all the information for event like eventtype, name, categoryflag etc

EventDispatcher class inside event
//use to bind the function based on event and call it when it received input
//return bool and input an event into it
//using EventFn = std::function<bool(T&)>;
//if (m_Event.GetEventType() == T::GetStaticType()) {
//	m_Event.m_Handled = func(*(T*)&m_Event);
//	return true;
//}

-------------LogicExplaination
-Event will be trigger everytime the input trigger which bind to glfw input.
-Input binding was binded inside the WindowsWindow.cpp during the initialization
-The EventDispatcher binding will be set either in EngineApplication.h(close/shutdown window) or ImGuiLayer.h(to bind and use all of the imgui functionality)
