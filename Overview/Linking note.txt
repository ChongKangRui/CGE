if application wan to use the third party library that using from engine, the third party library will need to export themself as  a dll file so application can use it.

Example:
Application want to use ImGui but it only link staticly with the Engine itself

solution: export imgui as dll to engine dll-> export engine dll to the application
this allow us to solve the linking problem and use the functionality from the application
