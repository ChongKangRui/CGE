Buffer.h

class IndexBuffer and VertexBuffer abstraction
-Only contain the function, not contain the data. This way allow us to implement the different implementation for both opengl and directx
-contain bind, unbind as well as a static function to create vertex and index

-enum ShaderDataType
Our own shaderdatatype in order to input the attribute into the shader program
//Use ShaderDataTypeSize(type) to get the size of the shader type. it is important because it let opengl to know
//the exact input data like position, color inside the array.

-struct BufferElements 
Contain Name, Offset, Size, Normalized and Type. allow to GetComponentCount()

class BufferLayout
-buffer layout contain std::vector<BufferElements>
-it will calculate stride and offset as well.

Shader.h
-Handle all of the shader work, use shader, delete shader, compile shader etc.
-need to pass in vertex and fragment shader program so that it can compile shader

OpenGLBuffer.h
class OpenGLVertexVuffer : public VertexBuffer
class OpenGLIndexBuffer : public IndexBuffer 
- both contain the data and implementation of the opengl shader

Note, the implementation will be inside the engineapplication
